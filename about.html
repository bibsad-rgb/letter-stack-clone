              <h1><b>Welcome to Letter Stack</b></h1>
              <p>Letter Stack is a word puzzle game inspired by classic word games, 
                designed to challenge your vocabulary and deduction skills. 
                Unlike traditional word games where you guess the entire word, 
                Letter Stack gives you the middle and challenges you to work outward!</p>

              <h2><b>The Conept</b></h2>
              <p>We believe that the best puzzles make you think differently. 
                By revealing the core of the word and asking you to build around it, 
                Letter Stack offers a fresh twist on word-guessing games. 
                It's perfect for coffee breaks, quick brain teasers, or whenever you need a 
                mental warm-up.</p>
